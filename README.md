# AI Threat Modeling Framework

A modular, lifecycle-aware framework for identifying and mitigating threats in AI systems. Inspired by MAESTRO and PLOT4AI, this framework supports NLP, CV, RL, and generative models.

## Features
- Lifecycle-based threat modeling (data, model, interface, environment)
- AI-specific threat taxonomy (adversarial ML, bias, privacy, misuse)
- Extensible threat mapping and mitigation strategies
- YAML-based model profiles for easy integration

## Getting Started
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python framework/threat_mapper.py --model examples/nlp_chatbot_model.yaml
